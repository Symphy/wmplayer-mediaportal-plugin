WMPlayer is a simple external player plugin that hosts Windows Media Player.

If you like the AC3Filter software http://www.ac3filter.net to playback AC3 and DTS, you can use it in MediaPortal now with this plugin.

If you have AC3filter decode into analog output, there's also the WMP visualization available (fullscreen only).

For MediaPortal 1.1.0.0 and up, the WMPlayer plugin is listed as "known extension" and can therefor be installed through the MPEInstaller program that comes with MediaPortal.

Older versions are available in the downloads section (Search for deprecated downloads).
